## **README: ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Django App**

### **Overview**
This Django application serves as a web interface for displaying temperature and humidity data collected from an ESP32-based sensor. The application leverages Django's powerful features for efficient development and management of the web interface.

### **Prerequisites**
* **Python:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
* **Django:** Install Django using `pip install Django`.
* **ESP32:** Have an ESP32 development board or module configured to send sensor data over HTTP.
* **Web Server:** A web server like Apache or Nginx (optional) to serve the Django application.

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository:** Download the source code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:** Set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run Migrations:** Create the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. **Start the Development Server:** Launch the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### **Configuration**
* **ESP32 Configuration:**
  - Configure your ESP32 to send HTTP requests to the Django application with the temperature and humidity data as parameters.
  - Ensure the ESP32 is connected to the same network as your Django application.
* **Django Settings:**
  - Adjust the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in `settings.py` to allow connections from your ESP32.
  - Configure database settings (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) in `settings.py`.

### **Usage**
1. **Access the Web Interface:** Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port).
2. **View Data:** The Django application will display the latest temperature and humidity readings from the ESP32 sensor.

### **Features**
* **Real-time Data Display:** The application updates the readings in real-time as the ESP32 sends new data.
* **Data Visualization:** Consider adding charts or graphs to visualize the temperature and humidity trends over time.
* **Data Logging:** Implement a mechanism to store historical data for analysis and reporting.
* **Customization:** Customize the appearance and functionality of the web interface to your preferences.

### **Additional Notes**
* **Security:** Protect your application from unauthorized access by implementing appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative feedback.
* **Scalability:** Consider using a production-ready web server and database for larger-scale deployments.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a production environment using a web server like Nginx or Apache.
